## /r/Daily_Programmer Challenge 294 - Rack Management

Today's challenge is inspired by the board game Scrabble. Given a set of 7 letter tiles and a word, 
determine whether you can make the given word using the given tiles.

### Bonus 1
ndle blank tiles (represented by "?"). These are "wild card" tiles that can stand in for any single letter.

### Bonus 2
Consider the case where every tile you use is worth a certain number of points, given on the Wikpedia page for Scrabble. E.g. a is worth 1 point, b is worth 3 points, etc.
For the purpose of this problem, if you use a blank tile to form a word, it counts as 0 points.
